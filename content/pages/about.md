My interest in coding started when I was 10 years old, and I needed to learn
<b>Lua</b> to play with the Minecraft Mod ComputerCraft. Since then, my
curiosity has led me to explore and learn everything about programming that I
can find and understand on the Internet. Although I have explored technologies
such as <b>C++</b>, <b>OpenGL</b>, <b>Vulkan</b>, <b>HTML</b> or <b>Python
</b>, I feel really comfortable with <b>Java</b> and <b>Rust</b>, and I try to
develop my projects on those platforms. If I'm known for something, it is for
my Minecraft mods, and thus I try to put a big effort on them and create quality
content for the players. Most recently I've been focused on learning hardware
design, specially in the areas arround CPU and GPU architectures.

On this web page, you will find all sort of <b>projects</b> and <b>devlogs
</b> written by me. I hope you enjoy it, and maybe find some piece of wisdom
that helps you on your current or future projects!
